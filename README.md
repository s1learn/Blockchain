# Blockchain
### Blockchain Fundamentals

Cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset which can be used to exchange value between parties.
It uses encryption to secure how it's transferred and to control creation new units of that currency.

###### Smart Contracts

A smart contract is computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of the contract.
The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries. 
Related economic goals include lowering fraud loss, arbitration and enforcement costs, and other transaction costs.

###### Four components of Bitcoin
- Software 
- Cryptography: 
- Hardware: 
- Gaming theory: 

1) Bitcoin Software throws a New cryptography challenge every 10 minutes
2) Global bitcoin miner communitry, Miners race to solve the challenge, to find naunce that satisfies the hash for the block
3) A miner solves the cryptography challenge first
4) The rest of the community verify the validity of the new block mined
5) The new valid block of bitcoin is added to the bitcoin blockchain
6) The winning miner earns a reward for solving the challenge first, currently 12.5 bitcoins per block added.

There is one coin based transaction without inputs, this is how the miners reward themselves for creating the valid block

###### Common Misconceptions

Bitcoin is anonymous; It is peudo anonymous
Bitcoin is used to Launder Money
Blockchain is better database; No reversals possible in Blockchain as every transaction immutable and permanent
Blockchoin is bitcoin; Blockchain is used in supply chain management, real estate, health care
You need to buy a full bitcoin


###### Bitcoin Cash

 A new cryptocurrency developed from a "Hard fork" in the bitcoin Blockchain (aug 1 2017)
 Increase block size to 8MB for the 1MB limit prior to the fork
 bitcoincash.org

The bitcoin blockchain is a constantly update ledge of transactions all the way back to the gensis block
New blocks are added approximately every ten minuts with the latest transactions
Each block that is added contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block thergy forming a "Blockchain"
On August 1, 2017 at 18:24:41 UTC, viaBTC pool produced a 1.9MB block (Block number 478,558), which is not valid on the legacy Bitcoin network which has 1MB block limit.

Max bitcoin limit to mine is 21 Million. Total bitcoins in circulation is 17 million.Mining reward and transaction fees are the rewards given. Volume of transactions also increase. Block size limit of 1MB limits the number of transactions within a block. There will be increase in transaction fee when the number of transaction increase. As per current trends, 21 million bitcoins by the year 2140. 50 bitcoins reward every 10 minutes. The reward is halved after some time is called halving.

###### Merkle Tree or Hash tree

A Merkle tree is a mathematical data structure composed of hashes of different blocks of data, and whichserves as a summary of all the transactions in a block.

Merkle root is the summary of all transactions in block.Concatenation of pair of hashes is repeated till the Merkle root is arrived.

###### BLOCKCHAIN CHARATERISTICS
Unique Characteristics of Blockchain Technology
- Decentralised, Peer to Peer Network
- Cannot be shutdown
- immutable shared ledger transactions
- consensus based
Provides trust between trustless parties
Efficient
- Audit on the go
- Near real time reconcilations
- Near real time  settlements

###### Benefits of Blockchain
Enables disintermediated business models
- Provides Trust
- Improves efficiency (near real time settlements)

Serves as a Public Ledger of transactions
- verified registry of records, events, contracts, assets etc.

###### Blockchain Types
1. Public 
   - Fully decentralised
   - Rules cannot be modified
   - Leverages computing power of several nodes
   - e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum
   - Permssionless Blockchain
 2. Private
    - Permissoned Blockchain
    - Enterprise Blockchain
    - e.g Eris and Stellar
 3. Consortium / Hybrid
    - a mix of both public and private
    - e.g R3 CEV (has 42 banks as members) Hyperledger
    - Helps bring several entities with common objectives on one Blockchain
    - Helps maintain IP within the group of firms
  
  ###### Blockchain Usecases beyond Cryptocurrencies
  1. Crowd Funding
  2. Land Tile Registries
  3. Asset Tracking
  4. Insurance
  5. Social Networks
  6. Airbnb ebay like marketplaces
  7. Prediction Markets
  8. Identity
  9. Voting
  10. Decentralized Autonoumous Organizations
  11. Real-time billing acorss Telecom Operators (e.g. Airtel, Vodafone)
