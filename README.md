It uses encryption to secure how it's transferred and to control creation new units of that currency.

Smart Contracts

A smart contract is omputerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of the contract.
The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries.

Bitcoin Cash

 A new cryptocurrency developed from a "Hard fork" in the bitcoin Blockchain (aug 1 2017)
 Increase block size to 8MB for the 1MB limit prior to the fork

The bitcoin blockchain is a constantly update ledge of transactions all the way back to the gensis block
New blocks are added approximately every ten minuts with the latest transactions
Each block that is added contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block thergy forming a "Blockchain"
On August 1, 2017 at 18:24:41 UTC, viaBTC pool produced a 1.9MB block (Block number 478,558), which is not valid on the legacy Bitcoin network which has 1MB block limit.

Max bitcoin limit to mine is 21 Million. Total bitcoins in circulation is 17 million.Mining reward and transaction fees are the rewards given. Volume of transactions also increase. Block size limit of 1MB limits the number of transactions within a block. There will be increase in transaction fee when the number of transaction increase. As per current trends, 21 million bitcoins by the year 2140. 50 bitcoins reward every 10 minutes. The reward is halved after some time is called halving.
